# 01c,10aug04,yvp  Removed fork, vfork and exec.

#
#  DESCRIPTION:
#  This file defines system call numbers for experimental VxWorks system calls.
#  This file complements syscallNum.def in that it allows developers to 
#  experiment with new system calls before commiting them into syscallNum.def
#  and syscallApi.def. Therefore any system calls defined in this file 
#  should finally be moved into the official system call definition files
#  syscallNum.def and syscallApi.def. 
#
#  IMPORTANT: THIS FILE WILL NOT BE SHIPPED AS PART OF THE PRODUCT. IT IS 
#             INTENDED FOR DEVELOPERS TO PROTOTYPE NEW SYSTEM CALLS ONLY.
#
#  FORMAT:
#  
#  The format is identical to that used by syscallNum.def.
#  A Group definition line defines one system call group. 
#  Its format is as follows:
#  
#  	SYSCALL_GROUP  SCG_<groupName>   <groupNumber> [ <configMacro(s)> ]
#  
#  For example "SYSCALL_GROUP SCG_fooLib 3" defines a System Call Group
#  "SCG_fooLib" for the kernel library fooLib, whose group number is
#  3. The group numbering scheme is as follows -
#  
#  	0 - 1        Reserved.
#  	2 - 7        Customer use.
#  	8 onwards    Wind River and partners
#
#  Following each System Call Group definition is the list of System Calls
#  included in that System Call Group. Each System Call is declared using
#  the format:
#
#	<number> <name> 
#
#  <number> is the system call number within the system call group
#  <name> is the name of the system call.
#
#  System call numbers within a given group should start at 0 and must be 
#  less than 256. They need not be sequential. 
#
#  This file is paired with a companion file named syscallApi.def that 
#  defines the system call API (i.e. function argument number & types).
#  These two files are parsed by the scgen utility to automatically generate
#  header files, assembly stubs  and initialized system call tables used by 
#  the system.
#
#  For uniformity and readability, all numbers used in this file are decimal.
