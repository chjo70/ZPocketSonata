C++ Demonstration Program
-------------------------

This C++ demo program demonstrates various C++ language features
including classes, templates, inheritance, function overloading,
exceptions, strings, and linked lists. You can build and download this
program to your VxWorks target.

This program should be run at a priority lower than the system tasks. The
priority of the task should be less than that of the network tasks to avoid
interfering with the network. When run from the shell, host or target shell,
it is advisable to run this program as a task (i.e. "-> sp main") rather than
directly invoking teh program (i.e. "-> main"). 

Features
--------

The main() function includes a loop that calls the following functions to 
demonstrate various C++ features:

* simpleClassDemo()         - construction, operating overloading, and
                              initialization
* inheritanceClassDemo()    - single inheritance
* multipleInheritanceDemo() - multiple inheritance
* staticDemo()              - static variables in a class
* templateClassDemo()       - an array template class
* largeClassDemo()          - a class with a large enumeration
* partialTypesDemo()        - pointers to undefined types
* virtualBaseDemo()         - multiple inheritance with a virtual base
                            class
* stringDemo()              - a string class
* exceptionDemo()           - exception handling
