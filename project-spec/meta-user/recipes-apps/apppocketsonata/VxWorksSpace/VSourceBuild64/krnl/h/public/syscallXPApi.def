# syscallXPApi.def - Experimental VxWorks System Call API Definition File

# modification history
# --------------------
# 01c,10aug04,yvp  Removed fork, vfork and exec.
# 01b,11may04,job  Removed tickGet, tick64Get & sysClkRateGet definitions
# 01a,19mar04,yvp  Written.
#
#  DESCRIPTION:
#  This file defines system call function API for experimental VxWorks system
#  calls. It complements syscallApi.def in that it allows developers to 
#  experiment with new system calls before commiting them into syscallNum.def
#  and syscallApi.def. Therefore any required system calls defined in this 
#  file should finally be moved into the official system call definition files
#  syscallNum.def and syscallApi.def before product release. 
#
#  IMPORTANT: THIS FILE WILL NOT BE SHIPPED AS PART OF THE PRODUCT. IT IS 
#             INTENDED FOR DEVELOPERS TO PROTOTYPE NEW SYSTEM CALLS ONLY.
#
#  FORMAT:
# 
#  The format is identical to that used by syscallApi.def.
#  A system call function API definition line has the format:
#  
#	 <name> <#args> [ <argument list> ] [ <configMacro(s)> ]
#
#  The name is the name of the system call. It must be the same as the name
#  mentioned in syscallNum.def.
#
#  <#args> is the number of arguments taken by the system call. For functions
#  taking 64-bit arguments on a 32-bit system, <#args> must be increased so
#  that <#args> reflects the total number of native-words occupied by the 
#  entire argument list. <#args> must not exceed 8.
#
#  <argument list> optionally defines the parameter list for this system call
#  for the purpose of automatical nameScArgs structure. The argument list is
#  enclosed in []'s, and individual arguments are separated by semicolons.
#
#  <configMacro(S)> is an optional list of macros, at least one of which must 
#  be defined, in order for this system call to be included into the system.
#
#  For example, the read system call number has the signature
#	read(int fd, void *buf, int len)
#
#  read 3 [ int fd; void *buf; int len; ] WIND_IO
#
#  Given the definition above, the read system call will be included into
#  the system only if WIND_IO is #defined in the configuration.
